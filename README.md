### ‚ú® Features



- **Black Box Design**: A matte 3D-printed enclosure with a centered button and hidden RGB LEDs around it.
- **"Ship it!" Engraving**: Stylish engraving right under the button for extra flair.
- **USB Plug & Play**: Acts as a keyboard when connected via USB.

### üîß Behavior

| Action             | Result                                                                 |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Plug in USB        | LEDs perform a **red breathing animation**, then fade to black (standby) |
| Press the button   | Triggers the **OBC launch animation** (purple LED chase effect), then sends `:ship: ship it! :rocket:` as keyboard input followed by `Enter` |
| Standby Mode       | LEDs stay off until the next press or animation |

### üåÄ Animations

- **Breathing Animation**: Gentle red glow mimicking breathing, plays once at start or in intervals.
- **OBC Animation**: Purple LED "chase" with acceleration, cruise, and deceleration phases.
- **Keyboard Input**: Automatically sends the message using USB HID after the animation.

### üî© Hardware
